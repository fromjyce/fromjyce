Hello there! I'm Jayashre, probably someone you haven't come across before. It's quite unusual for me to write a README about myself, considering it's typically reserved for applications and software. Nevertheless, here I am, crafting one for myself. Please spare a moment to learn more about me. I go by the name Jayashre, also known as JYCE. I'm passionate about Blockchain Development and Front-End Web Development. My expertise lies in Blockchain Development, Web Development, Machine Learning, and Operating Systems Security.
